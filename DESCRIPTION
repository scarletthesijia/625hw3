Description: There are 4 functions in this package, mylm.basic, mylm.detailed, describe.data and mylm.predict.
    mylm.basic is the most basic linear regression function, which returns the regressed model.
    mylm.detailed returns the same value as basic, but plots a diagnostic plot of the linear regression, printing each parameter of the model.
    describe.data can plot a histogram of the data and print the common statistical indicators of the data.
    mylm.predict uses the incoming model and independent variables to make predictions about the dependent variable and plots scatter plots of the independent and dependent variables.
